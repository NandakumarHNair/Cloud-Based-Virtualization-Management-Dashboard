## Project Overview
The Cloud-Based Virtualization Management Dashboard is a web-based application that allows users to manage virtual machines (VMs) in the cloud. It supports starting, stopping, and rebooting VMs and monitors their health using a simple web interface. This project uses AWS EC2 instances as an example, but the system can be extended to support multiple cloud providers.

## Features
- Manage EC2 instances (start, stop, reboot) using a simple web interface.
- Monitor the status of EC2 instances (running, stopped, etc.) in real-time.
- Multithreading to handle multiple VM management actions concurrently.
- Web-based dashboard for managing and monitoring virtual machines.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Flask, Boto3)
- AWS EC2 (for virtual machine management)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (AJAX for real-time VM status updates)
- Multithreading (to handle VM actions concurrently)
